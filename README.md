# Quantum Mechanics

In this course, I have studied

- Time dependent and Time Independent Schrodinger equation
- Bound states in an arbitrary potential
- Quantum theory of hydrogen-like atoms
- Atoms in Electric and Magnetic Fields
- Many electron atoms

In Practicals, we did computer programming to 

- Solve Schrodinger Equation for
    - Ground State and first excited state of H-atom
    - Electron trapped in the given potential
    - Particle in a Box
    - Particle in a HO potential and discuss asymptotic behavior for an electron subjected to the harmonic oscillator potential.
    - electron in H-atom
    - Screened Coulomb Potential
- Solve Radial Schrodinger Equation for different harmonic oscillator potentials
- Time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet

For the above problems, We use Numerov, Bisection, Finite Difference and other numerical techniques and determine the energy eigenvalues and corresponding normalised
wavefunctions for bound states.
